# Ethereum Gateway

Cloudflare's Ethereum Gateway lets you interact with the Ethereum network
without installing any software on your computer.

Our gateway makes it possible to add interactive elements to sites powered by
Ethereum smart contracts on a decentralized compute platform. Combined with the
[IPFS gateway](/web3/gateways/reference/ipfs-gateway/), you have decentralized web and
resource hosting with the added speed, security, and reliability of the
Cloudflare edge network. And you have direct access our Ethereum Gateway at
<https://cloudflare-eth.com>.

In particular, users can read all information that has been agreed upon by the consensus of
existing nodes in the network. In addition, they can write their own
transactions and smart contracts to be stored by these nodes in a distributed
manner. Anyone else on the network will be able to view these transactions, and
even run your smart contracts using their own supply of the Ethereum currency.

Cloudflare's Gateway is hosted at https://cloudflare-eth.com, can be interacted
with using the [official Ethereum JSONRPC
API](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC). This guide is for users
that would like to learn more about how to use our Gateway, including how to set
up your own domain as a entry-point to the Ethereum network, using the
Cloudflare Gateway.
